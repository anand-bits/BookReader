//Fragment

1. A screen is complete activity, so you can't add more than one activity.
2. As in WhatsApp, the green part is not changing, which means they are constant for each page.
3. Instead of adding an activity, we will add a fragment.

Advantages of fragments:

1. They take up less RAM than an activity, so the app works faster with fragments.
2. They are reusable across multiple activities.
3. Fragments have an independent lifecycle.
4. When the activity is not active, the lifecycle of the fragment will be the activity lifecycle.
5. A fragment is a modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, receives its own user inputs due to the user indirectly independently.
6. A fragment is part of the user interface of an activity.
7. A fragment represents behavior or a part of the user interface in an activity.
8. Any action that we perform to open or close a fragment is known as a fragment transaction. Each fragment transaction is stored inside a backstack, which is maintained by the activity.
